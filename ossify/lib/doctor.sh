# oss doctor - state health checks (spec §9.2 + §9.1 doctor entry).

# Read one advisory COUNT, and treat an unreadable field as UNREADABLE rather
# than as zero. The old `jq ... || echo 0` form was survivable only while these
# advisories printed nothing on a zero count: a corrupt `.demo_ledger` produced
# "0" and therefore silence. Once the clean `ok:` arms were added (round 2), the
# identical fallback started printing "ok: ledger - no pending amendments" over
# data it had failed to read - a check ASSERTING cleanliness about a field it
# could not parse, which is worse than the silence it replaced and contradicts
# the `skip:` contract every other check here follows.
#
# A count must also LOOK like a count: `jq -r` exits 0 while echoing `null` for
# a missing field, and `[ null -gt 0 ]` is a syntax error, not a zero.
#
# Every caller's expression opens with `_arr(f)`, which ERRORS unless the field
# is an array. That is not belt-and-braces: `jq`'s `length` is defined for
# almost everything, so `.patch_records | length` on an OBJECT quietly returns
# its key count and on a NUMBER returns its absolute value. Neither is a record
# count, and neither fails - so without the type guard a structurally wrong
# field produces a confident wrong number instead of a `skip:`. (Measured, when
# a test fixture using `{"a":1}` was expected to fail and reported `warn:
# patches - 1` instead.) (Codex P2, PR #149 round 3.)
# SLIMMED TO THE GATE (PR #184). doctor used to emit eight checks; the four that
# remain are the ones `close` blocks a MUTATION on, and they are the only ones
# that are not diagnosis:
#
#   state   the file is there at all
#   schema  oss_state_check_version - version legibility
#   replay  oss_state_replay - rebuild from the base snapshot, compare
#   shape   every required top-level key is present
#
# Replay is the reason this half stays deterministic. It reconstructs state by
# applying every journaled op to a base snapshot in sequence and comparing the
# result - exact-identity work, and the deterministic column names it. Nothing
# else in the plugin exposes it, and `close/SKILL.md` §3 requires schema and
# replay green before it writes. A rail before a mutation is not a read-out,
# whatever it is spelled with (PR #178's lesson, applied deliberately here).
#
# The OTHER four checks - lock, ledger/fakes/patches counts, and the repo-vs-state
# worktree comparison - were ~210 lines that opened files and described what they
# found. They are prose now, in doctor/references/state-inspection.md. They gated
# nothing: every one emitted `warn:` or `skip:`, neither of which ever set rc.

  # body, not just the top-level call (verified: a function called from an
  # `if` condition keeps `set -e` suspended through its own internal command
  # substitutions too). `rc` only accumulates; we never `return` early on a
