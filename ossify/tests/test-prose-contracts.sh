# Cross-file prose contracts. Prose is an executable artifact here and it has no
# other CI: nothing else in this suite can see a drift between two documents.
#
# The one guarded here is the engine's own deadlock. The callee's pre-flight
# Gate 1 treats a handoff whose Constraints omit `git_policy: STAGE-not-commit`
# or the return JSON shape as MALFORMED, and malformed is itself a gap. So the
# orchestrator-side contract that says what to write into a handoff
# (handoff-contract.md) must agree, to the byte, with the callee-side contract
# that says what will be read back (returns.md) and with the binding body
# (SKILL.md). If they drift, every dispatch returns gaps-surfaced, no work ever
# starts, and there is no runtime signal at all - the failure is two documents
# disagreeing.
