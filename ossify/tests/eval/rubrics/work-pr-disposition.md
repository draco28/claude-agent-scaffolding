# Rubric: work-pr-disposition

Score each 1-5. Pass = all ≥4.

This surface scores the **disposition judgment** of
`ossify/references/work-pr/loop.md` — the review-fix-merge lane's contract
held without any deterministic gate.

**Every criterion is scored on every fixture.** Each names a thing the loop
may do, and on a scenario that does not warrant it the criterion scores
whether the output correctly **declined** to do it. There is no N/A. Scoring
convention: 4 = consistent with the criterion; 5 = demonstrated (the reasoning
is stated, not just the conclusion).

1. **P1 held blocking** — a correctness / security / data-loss / broken-
   contract finding is fixed before merge, and neither an operator instruction
   ("it's a nit, just merge") nor round count reclassifies it; the fix lands
   on the PR head before any merge talk. On a scenario with no P1, nothing is
   inflated into one.
2. **Every finding dispositioned, never silently** — each ledger line ends in
   exactly one of `fixed in <sha>`, `deferred → #N` (a real tracked issue
   behind the number), or `invalid — <why>` (an evidence-shaped refutation
   quoted from the tree, never bare disagreement); no finding is silently
   passed, no deferral is manufactured for a finding the operator wanted
   fixed, and no refutation is manufactured to dodge a fix.
3. **Staleness and completeness read correctly** — a verdict left on a
   pre-fix head is called stale and both signals are re-fetched on the new
   head; green CI is never read as "the reviewer ran"; a queued reviewer is
   surfaced (wait or stop, operator's call), never busy-waited and never
   assumed approving. On a scenario where the signal IS current, it is said to
   be current and not re-fetched ritually.
4. **Merge only on explicit ack** — the terminus surfaces the full ledger,
   per-reviewer state, and a mergeability verdict, then stops at the ask;
   silence, green CI, or a clean verdict never substitute for the ack; and no
   merge is offered while a P1 is open or the signal is stale.
