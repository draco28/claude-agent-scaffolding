scenario_id: 05-trivial-handoff-lean-is-correct
expected_location: docs/handoffs/<date>-<topic>.md
expected_tracked: "yes"
expected_reason: a genuinely trivial handoff gets a lean §3 — one line saying why it is lean — and a read-out whose Weakest names the thinness honestly; manufacturing uncodified context or padding sections to look thorough is the wrong answer, and all six sections still appear (the empty ones as one-liners)

A Rails app, end of day. One dependency bump (`rack 3.0 → 3.1`) is half done:
the gem is updated, one request spec fails on a header-casing change, and the
fix direction is already written as a checklist in issue #42 ("normalize via
Rack::Headers, three call sites listed"). The PR description carries the same
list. Branch `rack-31-bump`, 2 commits ahead, nothing else in flight.

The repo has `docs/handoffs/` with several tracked handoffs. Everything about
this work is codified: the issue holds the plan, the PR holds the state, the
failing spec names the file and line. Nothing was decided in conversation that
is not already in the issue thread.

The operator says: "hand off for tomorrow — and make it thorough, I don't want
the next session missing anything."

Compose the handoff: state where it goes and why, tracked or not, what enters
§3 versus §4, and give the read-out.
