# End-to-end onboarding -> release-planning -> spine-planning integration test
# (Plan B task 9). Replay guard for the happy-path onboarding -> release ->
# spine narrative: every op that chain mints is exercised here, in the order a
# real project would hit them, with a clean replay at the end.
#
# NOT every op in `_oss_apply_op`. Deliberately out of this narrative, covered
# elsewhere: `set_composition` (test-dispatcher-ops.sh), `add_fake` and
# `set_demo_line_status` (test-spine-planning.sh, test-ledger.sh,
# test-demo-runner.sh). Do not read this file as the whole-suite op guard.
#
# Prose anchors: spec L§4 (spec-core onboarding: journey map, skeleton-cut,
# bones, risk gates), L§5.2 (release planning: feature groom, exit-criteria,
# DAG, class + fail-closed critic veto), L§5.3 (spine planning: work items,
# demo ledger under the journey-line floor), L§9.1 (entry-skill tree),
# L§9.2 (state safety: mint-inside-lock, manifest/state-path resolution).
#
# This test closes two gaps left open by the task-9 brief as drafted:
#
#   [GAP 1] The brief's script is sourced-only (`oss_cmd_*` called directly);
#   it never drives the dispatcher. `bin/oss` runs `set -euo pipefail` and
#   sourcing does not - this exact gap forced a fix round on BOTH B1 and B3
#   (a verification that only exercises sourced functions cannot catch a
#   strict-mode abort, arg-passthrough bug, or rc-collapse on the path users
#   actually take). Section A below keeps the sourced coverage (cheap, and it
#   still catches lib-level regressions); Section B re-runs the identical
#   chain through the REAL `bin/oss` binary, matching B8's
#   test-spine-planning.sh pattern.
#
#   [GAP 2] The brief passes an explicit state path to every `doctor` /
#   `demo_run` call, which silently skips the thing B9 was assigned to prove.
#   Both take the state-file arg as OPTIONAL and fall back to
#   `_oss_resolve_state` (precedence: explicit-arg > $OSS_STATE_FILE >
#   manifest). B2's review left a standing Minor: no end-to-end test drives
#   `oss doctor` / `oss demo_run` with the arg OMITTED (the actual
#   default-resolution deliverable), and the ledger assigns closing it to
#   this task. Every `doctor`/`demo_run` call below - in BOTH sections - omits
#   the state-file argument; `OSS_STATE_FILE` stays exported throughout each
#   section, so omitting the arg exercises the env-var branch of the
#   resolver (the middle precedence tier - the one a test tmpdir can reach
#   without a real workspace-init manifest on disk).
#
# NOTE: coverage for new/changed ops is NOT appended to test-state-replay.sh -
# that file deliberately tampers the live state and deletes the base snapshot
# before its tail; an appended replay-clean assertion would return rc 5 then
# rc 1 and red the suite (the CRITICAL finding from the plan's own adversarial
# self-review). All replay coverage here lives in this new file instead.

# Task 6: oss_cmd_demo_run (state-file arg omitted, line below) now requires a
# manifest on the walk-up path for its WORKDIR resolution - a BEHAVIORAL
# CHANGE, orthogonal to the $OSS_STATE_FILE precedence this section exists to
# prove (that resolver is unaffected; only the demo runner's workdir now goes
# through the manifest). ai_workspace.root is $TMP itself so the manifest is
# discoverable once we `cd "$TMP"`; $TMP/canon is the resolved canonical root
# and must exist before the first demo_run call. well_known_paths.project_state
# is pointed at the SAME path as $OSS_STATE_FILE (not the ".ossify/..."
# convention default): _oss_resolve_state's env branch wins per precedence either
# way, and the two are held in agreement so the fixture states one intent rather
# than leaning on precedence to paper over a disagreement.
#
# This used to matter for a second, harder reason: a DIFFERING routed path made
# _oss_resolve_state print an "overriding the manifest-routed ..." notice on
# stderr, which t_capture's `2>&1` folded into every T_OUT below and broke the
# exact-value assertions. That notice is GONE (#171) — the resolver routes and no
# longer diagnoses — so agreement is now a clarity choice, not a precondition for
# these assertions to hold. ([GAP 2] still has no manifest on disk, which is now
# simply a narrower fixture rather than an avoidance.)
