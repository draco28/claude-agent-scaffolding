description: Pair a new AI workspace with an existing canonical repository (Scenario A). Wraps the pairing-canonical-repo skill.
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Write", "Bash"]
---

Invoke the `pairing-canonical-repo` skill from the workspace-init plugin.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, treat it as the absolute path to the existing canonical repository. Otherwise, prompt for the path interactively.

Follow the skill body exactly. Validate per SPEC §9.4 abort conditions before touching anything (refuse if the canonical already has AI scaffolding — `.claude/memory-bank/`, `MASTER-SPEC.md`, `docs/MASTER-SPEC.md`, or `.claude/.onboarding-state.json`). Do not modify the existing canonical's working tree — only install the commit-msg hook in its `.git/hooks/` and stage the new AI workspace.
